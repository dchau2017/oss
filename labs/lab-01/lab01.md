## Part 2: Reading Assignments
3. Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way (from your past experience)?  

*Understand the context of the question.* This means understanding the background of the question asker, why they are asking this question, and what level of 
explanation they are looking for. Understanding these values will help you craft the best possible answer.

*Use visual aids.* A verbal explanaiton can be sufficent. But being able to draw diagrams and visualizing certain concepts can help you get your point across clearer and
quicker. 


4. Please read chapter 3 of Free Culture. Write a short paragraph (8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
After reading chapter 3 of Free Culture, what I found interesting was how the RIAA was able to build a case against Jesse. Jesse slightly modified 
a search engine to improve user accessbility; he did not build it with the intention to aid pirating. Yet, the RIAA was able to build a case saying that 
Jesse built this search engine with then intention of piarting. In my opinion, nobody is really at fault for this as neither Microsoft or Jesse built/modified
the search engine with the intention of piracy. The apporporiate solution would to modify the search engine to not search private users folders and to tell
students to not put private music/videos in public facing folders for the search engine to query. However, this happened in 2002 where the internet, search engines,
and privacy issues were just arising so it makes sense most students would just put their music/videos in their public-facing folders since they didn't really 
understand privacy concerns at the time. Reading this also showed me how hungry for money the RIAA/big companies are for money. They spent time building a case
against 3 students knowing they would not have the resources to fight back and would have to settle.

## Part 6: Reflection
Overall this lab went well. I've had previous experience using git so forking/setting up this repo was pretty easy. I'm not very used to writing Markdown,
but I read some of the guides provided and that helped me alot. The readings were pretty straightforward and easy to read. I've had previous experience using
Linux so setting everything up went well. It has been a while since I've worked with regular expressions so I struggled a bit here. Fortunatley, there were alot of 
guides online that helped me learn and work through the problems. The Blocky went well even though it took some time to learn the game and code the solution. 
I took a look at current Open Source Projects that I might want to look at such as Submitty, YACS, Quacs, and other projects provided in the aosabook link. 
I have also started thinking about what kind of open source project I want to do this semester as well.
