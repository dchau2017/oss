## Part 2 - Community:

### Project 1: DormDesign

**Number of Contributors**: 2

**Lines of Code:** 22680 lines

**First Commit:** 9/8/2020: Inital Commit by Graham Misail

**Latest Commit:** 2/12/2021: Include stub for database by Graham Misail

**Current Branches:** Master, port-backend, editor-improvements, duplicate-item, error-pages, dockerizing, templates, settings-set-title, tweaks-and-fixes, heroku

**Comparison:** GitStats says there are 22328 lines of code (probably includes code in seperate branches) whereas 
the grep command used earlier only accounted for master. Commit number matches the previous part. GitStats says there are
4 contributors even though only 2 are listed on GitHub. Looking at the author tabs, it looks like there are only 2 contributors
but they are double-listed. GitStats has an easier UI to find earliest commit date compared to GitHub. Also has interesting stats
about day/times of commit.

### Project 2: Exalendar

**Number of Contributors:** 6

**Lines of Code:** 58269 lines

**First Commit:** 9/15/2020: Inital Commit by NatSR4

**Last Commit:** 2/12/2021: Delete about.html by NatSR4

**Current Branches:** master, login, Calendar, Settings, Database-prototyping, learning-nicholas, Learning-Kyra

**Comparison**: Exalendar says there are only 7410 lines of code and 8 authors. But it looks like 2 authors are double-listed as well.
It looks like GitStats doesn't count .png files as part of the line count so that explains the difference in the two values.

### Project 3: FLOM

**Number of Contributors:** 9

**Lines of Code:** 104793 lines

**First Commit:** 1/22/2019: Inital Commit by jadeforman

**Last Commit:** 4/28/2020: nav bar by ChoiJustin

**Current Branches:**  16 branches (master, 404page, changeabout, etc...)

**Comparison**: GitStats says there are 80965 lines of code so there is a bit of a difference there. GitStats says there are
16 authors but it looks like some are double listed (lists both real name and username). Commit history is accurate and so is number
of branches. GitStats has more advance stats and graphs to track time/date of each commit to see patterns.

### Project 4: Flutter Shutter Tracker

**Number of Contributors:** 5

**Lines of Code:** 37641 lines

**First Commit:**: 2/21/2020 Inital Commit by DerekLi

**Last Commit:**: 12/6/2020 Commented Code and Documentation by RRM123

**Current Branches:**: 13 branches (master, eta_panel, feature-geolocation, etc...)

**Comparison**: GitStats says there are 6 authors but one is double-listed. GitStats there are 18887 lines of code
but it looks like GitStats does not count some file extension as part of the lines of code count so that explains the
difference. Commit history matches as well as number of branches. GitStats has more advanced graphs to track commit history/activity. 
Also lists lines of code by extension which is nice.
