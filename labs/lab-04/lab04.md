# Lab 4 - Open Source Licensing

### Question 1:
![CC License](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/72af7c8e70a45c471163e803748d0338b3b2b52f6b040804e549e4163de72a58/68747470733a2f2f692e6372656174697665636f6d6d6f6e732e6f72672f6c2f62792f342e302f38387833312e706e67) This work is licensed under a http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.



### Question 3:
It is important to choose a license since it allows potential users to use, modify, or sell/share the program or source code based on 
the software owner's terms and conditions. This ensures that software is not properly misused or abused according to the creator's discretion.
Furthermore, in order to be officaly open source, the program must have a license associated with it. Choosing the proper license defines how
users can use/re-purpose the software. Failing to comply with the license can lead to breaks in copyright laws.

### Question 4:
We should not use a project that does not have a license. The reason being is that a project with no license is by default
"all rights reserved" meaning that no other user except the owner has the right to use/modify/sell the software without 
the consent of the creator. Therefore, it is generally a good idea not to use software that is not licensed.

### Question 5:
I agree with the claims made in "Why the Web Beat Gopher". By having the source code open to be viewed and critiqued by the public, it allows
bugs to be found and fixed quicker by the community at large. Furthermore, the users have an incentive to fix these bugs since they will be the ones
using it. I also found it interesing how Gopher forked before having a stand-alone, finished project, meaning that they deviated with multiple
different approaches leading to inefficent work. If they had been open from the start, maybe it would have worked out for them.

#### Question 6:
It makes sense that SailFishOS is not open source. SailFishOS is a OS for mobile phones created by Jolla [Source](https://jolla-devices.com/sailfish_devices/) and used
in a handful of smartphones. Jolla does not want the code for their OS to be open source since it could lead to security issues if hackers can view the source
code and find vulnerabilities. Furthermore, SailFishOS might have features unique to it that Jolla wants to keep secret from competing mobile OS companies in
case they want to steal those features.
